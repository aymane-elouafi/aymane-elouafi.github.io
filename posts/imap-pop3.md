**What IMAP is**

- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** = a protocol for **accessing/reading** emails stored on a mail server.
- It manages emails **online, directly on the server** (not just downloading them), and supports **folder structures**.
- Client-server based: it **syncs** your local email client with the server mailbox — like a "network file system for email."

**IMAP vs. POP3 (the key comparison)**

- **IMAP**: full online management — folders/hierarchy, access multiple mailboxes in one session, browse/preselect emails on the server, multiple clients stay in sync.
- **POP3**: bare-bones — can only **list, retrieve, and delete** emails. No folders, no server-side management.
- Bottom line: **IMAP keeps mail on the server and syncs everywhere; POP3 is a simpler download-and-go protocol.**

**How IMAP behaves**

- Emails **stay on the server** until you delete them.
- Multiple clients/users can access the same mailbox at once and all see a **uniform, synced database**.
- Needs an **active connection** to manage mail (some clients offer an offline mode with a local copy that syncs changes once reconnected).
- **Text-based**, ASCII commands. You can send several commands in a row without waiting for replies — responses are matched back to commands using **identifiers** sent with each one.

**Connection & auth**

- Connects on **port 143**.
- Immediately after connecting, you **authenticate with username + password** — no mailbox access until that succeeds.

**Works alongside SMTP**

- **SMTP sends** mail; **IMAP reads** it.
- Copying sent emails into an IMAP folder means **every client sees your sent mail**, no matter which device sent it.
- You can build **personal folders/structures** to organize the mailbox — but this uses **more storage** on the server.

**Security**

- Plain IMAP is **clear-text** — commands, emails, usernames, and passwords all travel readable over the network.
- **SSL/TLS encryption** is used to secure it.
- **Ports to remember: 143** (plain, or STARTTLS-upgraded) and **993** (IMAP over SSL/TLS).

## Default Configuration :

- packages `dovecot-imapd`, and `dovecot-pop3d` using `apt`

## IMAP Commands

## Footprinting the Service 

By default, ports `110` and `995` are used for POP3, and ports `143` and `993` are used for IMAP. The higher ports (`993` and `995`) use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between the client and server. Using Nmap, we can scan the server for these ports. The scan will return the corresponding information (as seen below) if the server uses an embedded certificate.

```shell
aymane0x90@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -p110,143,993,995 -sC

```

For example, from the output, we can see that the common name is `mail1.inlanefreight.htb`, and the email server belongs to the organization `Inlanefreight`, which is located in California. The displayed capabilities show us the commands available on the server and for the service on the corresponding port.

If we successfully figure out the access credentials for one of the employees, an attacker could log in to the mail server and read or even send the individual messages.

## cURL

```shell
aymane0x90@htb[/htb]$ curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user user:p4ssw0rd

* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." Important
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." INBOX
```

If we also use the `verbose` (`-v`) option, we will see how the connection is made. From this, we can see the version of TLS used for encryption, further details of the SSL certificate, and even the banner, which will often contain the version of the mail server.

```shell

To interact with the IMAP or POP3 server over SSL, we can use `openssl`, as well as `ncat`. The commands for this would look like this:

Once we have successfully initiated a connection and logged in to the target mail server, we can use the above commands to work with and navigate the server.
